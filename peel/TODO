BUGS :

- 'choose one' in select doesn't behave properly.

bug notes : for <select>'s,  we should use
    <select>
        <option value="" disabled selected>Select your option</option>
        <option value="hurr">Durr</option>
    </select>
  that way, the "select your option" choice will never be shown as the value in the changeEditor. (unless it's the initial value
  which it should never be?)  i could look for option:not(disabled).


TODO :
XX add test cases.  url for different datasets (or load data from ajax?)
Xhandle very long values.  ellipsis and text overflow
Xallow configuration of .css for icon placement.   each and every field has a selector.
*need a map of all possible data-change-id's and their .css classes to add to icon.
-restyle "alerts"

- start integration with PEEL.
- how to handle parent/container.  e.g. Vehicle with has many sub changes (make, year, model).  i want this to show up as a single
 change ("vehicle 2 has changed") instead of "make has changed, year has changed, model has changed" etc...
