<h1>Change Editor</h1>

<h3>History</h3>
<span>
    The constraints/goals were to make a widget that would render on top of an existing form and show all the changes
    and allow the user to make edits.  It was originally destined for PEEL but shelved but continued in hopes of usage by a future project.
    The main idea is that change data would be calculated on the server side (by new XML based policy change code) and a .json version of that
    would be sent to this widget and that's all you would have to do.
</span>


<h3>Architectural Overview</h3>

<p>
    The concept of "Change Editor" really involves three distinct things.
    - the parent/mediator changeEditor class
    - a changePanel which is the component that lists the changes.  typically located in top right of form.
    - 0..n changeInput widgets which is the icon & popup beside each input field that has a change.

    *see image changeEditor.png to get a better idea.

    Basically, the developer will add some code to initialize the editor.
    This in turn will always create a change panel and populate it with the given data  (options.changes[])
    It will then look for any related input fields and create appropriate changeInputs.
    Any events triggered from the changePanel or changeInputs will be handled by the changeEditor class.

    It is very important to understand that the whole thing is based on the assumption that there will be
    1: data sent with an array of changes = {id: ?, type:'add|modify|delete', values:[])
    2: if an input element in the form is associated with that change, then it MUST have the attribute "data-change-id" with the appropriate matching value.
    3: the options.config property has a map used to get the display value of the change.

    for example:
        if passed in the given options json object (i'm leaving out lots of properties for concision)
</p>
    <code>
        var options = {
                changes : [ {id:1, type:'modify', values:[...]}],
                config : { idLabels:{1:'Vehicle Manufacturer', ...}
        }
        // somewhere else in the form html....
        &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; data-change-id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
    </code>
        In this case, the change has an id of 1 and it's associated label/description is 'Vehicle Manufacturer'.
        The input field will have a changeInput widget created for it because of its matching data-change-id attribute.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Is this a wicket widget?
    <div>No.  Currently it isn't but one that incoporated the required .js/.css could/should be written.  But at the end of the day
    all the real UI work is done on the browser in the DOM, not on the server side.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Are new changes (i.e. done by the user while looking at the form with existing changes) handled?
        <div>Yes. If the user clicks on a relevant <input> and changes it, a new change will be created and marked.  It will show up in the panel
            and look/act just like the other ones.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Are these new changes sent back to server?
        <div>No.  But they could be if client is given a URL to post to.  They will disappear once you leave the page.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Deleted entities can't be reverted like modifications.  why?
        <div>In order to do that, the change editor would need to have a URL to post to *and* all of the details of the deleted entity (not just a description as shown now).
        It could be done but most of the work is on the server side and it wasn't a required feature.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Added entities can't be reverted like modifications.  why?
        <div>Basically same as above. In this case, the user can just click 'delete' themselves to revert.  Again this is do-able with some work but not in initial scope.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Does this widget need to render on top of the full form?
        <div>Sort of.  You can just show the editor without any form behind it, everything will look fine but keep in mind that...
            - you are in effect in a read only state because there is no form being posted.  .: any changes you make (by clicking on toggle buttons)
              will *not* be changing any underlying form data (because there is none).   So it could be used as a "look at the summary" type widget.
            - display values for changes may not render correctly.   for example, if there is a change based on a select...
               option value="M"  MALE
               option value="F"  FEMALE
             the editor will *not* be able to show "MALE", instead it will show "M".  This is because it can't inspect the underlying form and find the display value.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        What dependencies are there?
        <div>The external dependencies are jquery/jquery ui.
            It also depends on two utility files (Utils & IE_Shim) as well as the core .js/.css
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        What work is left to be done.
        <div>
            - there is a proposed concept of "rolling up changes".  e.g. if a vehicle has many fields including make, year, manufacturer, colour and model etc.
            then it is desired that if all those fields change it would just show up as "Vehicle X" has changed instead of "Vehicle X's make", "Vehicle X's year" etc...
            - now, only simple inputs and easyJSCombo are supported.  I did easyJScombo because it is the hardest and i'm sure all others can be handled but code
            will be required in valHooks.js for other widget types (date picker, yes/no, etc...)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Can the change panel be moved/resized?
        <div>
            You can't move/resize it by dragging on corners.  Currently there is a minimize button which collapses it to a single row
            (maximize is configurable by .css with the default being about 8 rows).   There is also a "fullwidth" mode in which it takes up the
            full width of it's container.  This mode is more suited for "view as summary" and offers no max/min capabilities.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Is there a limit to the number of changes?
        <div>
            No. the panel should scroll to acommodate any number.  memory is not an issue because each change is pretty small.
        </div>

        Do i *need* to have bootstrap for this?
        <div>
            If you use the default HTML templates you do because they involve bootstrap classes like "panel", "list-group" etc..
            If you can't or don't want bootstrap, then supply your own html and .css.    See below on how to configure your html.

<h3>Customizing</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>
Customizing is done via the options object passed to the widget at initialization time.


*NOTE: in order to get a better understanding of this, reading up on jquery ui widget creation, the javascript module pattern
and jquery valHooks would be a great start.

<ul>
    <li>
        How do i change the layout/html.
        <div>This is done by specifying the selector for the templates used by the widget.
        </div>
        <p>
            options.config.template = {
                // contains the header part of the change panel
                changePanelTitle: '#mypanelTitle',
                // contains the template content for each change. (will be repeated for each one).
                changePanelContent: '#mypanelcontent',
                // template for additions. typically just an information blurb
                add: '#myadd',
                // same as "add" template.
                delete: '#mydelete',
            }
            </p>

    </li>
    <li>
        What variables can i put in the layout.
        <div>You can add anything that's in the .json object - just put it in curly brackets.
        for example, the default header template contains
        <code>
            &lt;span class=&quot;change-panel-title&quot;&gt;{{config.header}}&lt;/span&gt;
        </code>
        because the options object contains config: { header:'', ...} this is valid.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        How do i specify the container of the list of change items?
        <div>
            because you are only allowed to give the template of each item (this is iterated over), the widget creates a container for the change items.
            it is always a div but you can configure the css class via the options.config.panelContainerClass property.
            by default, it is 'change-panel panel panel-default'.   The panel/panel-default classes are for bootstrap purposes.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Can I change the html attributes used?
        <div>Yes - currently the default is "data-change-id" & "data-ref-id".
        These can be specified via options.config.idAttr & options.config.refAttr properties.
            (*I would like to change it to "data-model-id" because it doesn't necessarily represent a change.  the id is to identify
            the place the data is stored.)
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
