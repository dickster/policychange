<h1>Change Editor</h1>

<h3>History</h3>
<span>
    The constraints/goals were to make a widget that would render on top of an existing form and show all the changes
    and allow the user to make edits.  It was originally destined for PEEL but shelved but continued in hopes of usage by a future project.
    The main idea is that change data would be calculated on the server side (by new XML based policy change code) and a .json version of that
    would be sent to this widget and that's all you would have to do.
</span>


<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Is this a wicket widget?
    <div>No.  Currently it isn't but one that incoporated the required .js/.css could/should be written.  But at the end of the day
    all the real UI work is done on the browser in the DOM, not on the server side.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Are new changes (i.e. done by the user while looking at the form with existing changes) handled?
        <div>Yes. If the user clicks on a relevant <input> and changes it, a new change will be created and marked.  It will show up in the panel
            and look/act just like the other ones.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Are these new changes sent back to server?
        <div>No.  But they could be if client is given a URL to post to.  They will disappear once you leave the page.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Deleted entities can't be reverted like modifications.  why?
        <div>In order to do that, the change editor would need to have a URL to post to *and* all of the details of the deleted entity (not just a description as shown now).
        It could be done but most of the work is on the server side and it wasn't a required feature.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Added entities can't be reverted like modifications.  why?
        <div>Basically same as above. In this case, the user can just click 'delete' themselves to revert.  Again this is do-able with some work but not in initial scope.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Does this widget need to render on top of the full form?
        <div>Sort of.  You can just show the editor without any form behind it, everything will look fine but keep in mind that...
            - you are in effect in a read only state because there is no form being posted.  .: any changes you make (by clicking on toggle buttons)
              will *not* be changing any underlying form data (because there is none).   So it could be used as a "look at the summary" type widget.
            - display values for changes may not render correctly.   for example, if there is a change based on a select...
               option value="M"  MALE
               option value="F"  FEMALE
             the editor will *not* be able to show "MALE", instead it will show "M".  This is because it can't inspect the underlying form and find the display value.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        What dependencies are there?
        <div>The external dependencies are jquery/jquery ui.
            It also depends on two utility files (Utils & IE_Shim) as well as the core .js/.css
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        What work is left to be done.
        <div>
            - there is a proposed concept of "rolling up changes".  e.g. if a vehicle has many fields including make, year, manufacturer, colour and model etc.
            then it is desired that if all those fields change it would just show up as "Vehicle X" has changed instead of "Vehicle X's make", "Vehicle X's year" etc...
            - now, only simple inputs and easyJSCombo are supported.  I did easyJScombo because it is the hardest and i'm sure all others can be handled but code
            will be required in valHooks.js for other widget types (date picker, yes/no, etc...)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Can the change panel be moved/resized?
        <div>
            You can't move/resize it by dragging on corners.  Currently there is a minimize button which collapses it to a single row
            (maximize is configurable by .css with the default being about 8 rows).   There is also a "fullwidth" mode in which it takes up the
            full width of it's container.  This mode is more suited for "view as summary" and offers no max/min capabilities.
        </div>

        Is there a limit to the number of changes?
        <div>
            No. the panel should scroll to acommodate any number.  memory is not an issue because each change is pretty small.

<h3>Customizing</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>
Customizing is done via the options object passed to the widget at initialization time.


*NOTE: in order to get a better understanding of this, reading up on jquery ui widget creation, the javascript module pattern
and jquery valHooks would be a great start.
