- edge cases.  (see if error handling is satisfactory.  does it blow up? log error message, help you understand problem...?)
  pass in bad data (incorrect or missing properties - particularly for changes).
  incorrect template ids.
  missing values are defaulted correctly (specify minimum and see if things work)
  very long values for both carrier and broker.  make sure they are truncated... and fit on screen properly.
  (for long values, the text should be split onto two rows).

change panel:
- change panel in fullwidth mode vs regular.  fullwidth should take up all the space of its container.
  maximize/minimize - min should only show one row.  max is arbitrarily styled to about 8 or so.
  row in change panel should be highlighted & visible when you click next/prev.  (i.e. scrolling should be done if row isn't in viewport).
  clicking on row should select change.  it's corresponding input in form (if visible) should blink yellow (and scrolled onscreen if not already)
  clicking on the field name in the row (e.g. Manufacturer) will select the item (as above) AND open the popup associated with the input.
  clicking toggle button (which isn't always visible) should go from "broker" to "carrier" value.
  if user sets the value of an input to something other than "broker" or "carrier" value, the corresponding row in change panel will NOT show a toggle button but rather a warning/override icon.
   (which does nothing if clicked on).

change input popover:
  clicking on icon (asterisk) beside input will show popup.  it has the "broker" and "carrier" values. clicking on either of these will change the value of the input.
  if the input currently is set to the broker or carrier value, then that row will have a check mark beside it in the popup.  if neither of these is the current value, then no check marks will appear.
  as you hover over the row, a bolder check mark will appear to signal that you can select it by clicking.
  clicking on next/prev arrows will close current input popover and open the next/prev one.  the window will scroll if need be.
